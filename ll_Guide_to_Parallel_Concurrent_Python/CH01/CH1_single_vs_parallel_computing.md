# Sequential vs. Parallel Computing

## Sequential Computing
Sequential computing is the traditional programming approach where instructions are executed one after another by a single processor, with only one instruction being executed at a time. The processor's capabilities limit the speed of execution.

*Barron illustrated this concept as a single cook making a salad, which took him three minutes to complete.*

## Parallel Computing
Parallel computing utilizes multiple processors working simultaneously on different parts of a task. This approach breaks down tasks into independent parts that can be executed in parallel.

*Barron and Olivia demonstrated this concept as two cooks computing in parallel to make a salad, which took them two minutes to completeâ€”less time than it took Barron to make a salad alone using sequential computing.*

## Advantages of Parallel Computing
- Significantly increases the overall throughput of a program by enabling faster completion of large or complex tasks.
- Enables the computer to accomplish more tasks in a given amount of time.
- Makes it possible to solve problems too large or complex for a single processor.
- In many industries, the time saved using parallel computing often outweighs the costs of investing in specialized hardware.

## Challenges of Parallel Computing
- Increases the complexity of programming, requiring careful coordination between processors to ensure efficient execution.
- Adding more processors doesn't always result in a proportional increase in speed due to coordination overhead.
- There may be waiting times between dependent tasks, which can affect overall performance.

## Real-World Applications
- Web search engines use parallel computing to process millions of transactions every second.
- Many other industries leverage parallel computing, where time savings translate directly to cost savings.

## Key Takeaways
- Parallel computing offers significant performance benefits for tasks that can be effectively parallelized.
- Implementing parallel solutions requires careful planning and coordination to overcome inherent challenges.
- Parallel computing has grown in importance across various industries due to its ability to handle complex, data-intensive tasks; it is essential for solving large-scale computing problems in modern applications.
