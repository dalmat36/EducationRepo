# Threads vs. Processes

---

## Processes
- An instance of a program executing on a computer
- Consists of the program's code, data, and state information
- Each process has its own independent address space in memory
- Computers can manage hundreds of active processes simultaneously

---

## Threads
- Smaller subelements that exist within a process
- Represent independent paths of execution through a program
- Basic units managed by the operating system for execution
- Multiple threads within a process share the same address space and resources

---

## Comparison of Processes and Threads
- Processes are isolated from each other, each with its own address space
- Threads within the same process can easily share resources and communicate
- Interprocess communication is possible but requires special mechanisms
- Threads are generally considered "lightweight" compared to processes
- Creating and terminating threads typically requires less overhead than processes
- Switching between threads of the same process is usually faster than switching between different processes

## Analogy: Cooking in the Kitchen
- A process is likened to a kitchen (address space) where cooking occurs
- Threads are represented by cooks working on different tasks within the same kitchen
- Different processes are compared to separate kitchens working on distinct meals

---

## Choosing Between Threads and Processes
- The choice depends on the specific task and operating environment
- Threads are generally recommended when possible due to their lightweight nature
- Implementing threads and processes can vary across operating systems and programming languages
