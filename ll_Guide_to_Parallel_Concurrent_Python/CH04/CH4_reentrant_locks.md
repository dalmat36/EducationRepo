# Reentrant Mutexes

A **reentrant mutex** is a type of mutex that can be locked multiple times by the same thread or process. It keeps track internally of how many times it has been locked by the owning thread. The reentrant mutex must be unlocked an equal number of times before another thread can acquire it.

Reentrant mutexes are also known as "recursive mutexes" or "recursive locks" in various programming languages.

## Reentrant Mutexes vs. Standard Mutexes
- Standard mutexes can lead to deadlocks if a thread tries to lock a mutex it already owns
- Reentrant mutexes prevent this type of deadlock by allowing multiple locks by the same thread

---

## Use Cases for Reentrant Mutexes

### Nested Function Calls
- Useful when functions that use locks are called within other locked sections of code
- This scenario can occur when retrofitting locks into existing code or when creating functions that use other locked functions

### Recursive Functions
- Essential for recursive functions that need to lock resources
- As the function calls itself, it can lock the mutex multiple times and then unlock it an equal number of times as it unwinds

---

## Advantages and Considerations
- Reentrant mutexes can simplify coding by reducing concerns about what has already been locked
- Can facilitate easier integration of locks into existing code structures
- There is debate in the programming community about their use, with some arguing for code refactoring to avoid nested locks instead
