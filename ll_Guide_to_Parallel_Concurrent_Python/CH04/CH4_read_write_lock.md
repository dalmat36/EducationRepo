# The Problem with Basic Locks
Basic locks restrict access to one thread at a time, regardless of whether it's reading or writing. This approach is not always efficient, especially when many threads only need to read shared data.

## Reader-Writer Locks
Reader-writer locks (or shared mutexes) offer a more flexible solution for managing concurrent access. They can be locked in one of two modes:
- **Shared "READ" mode:** Allows multiple threads to read simultaneously
- **Exclusive "WRITE" mode:** Restricts access to one thread for writing

---

## How Reader-Writer Locks Work
- Multiple threads can acquire a shared read lock concurrently
- Only one thread can acquire an exclusive write lock at a time
- When a thread holds a write lock, no other threads can acquire either a read or write lock
- Write locks cannot be acquired while any read locks are held

---

## Use Cases and Considerations
- Beneficial when there are significantly more read operations than write operations
- Can improve performance in scenarios like certain types of database applications
- Potential downside: more complex to implement and typically use more resources than standard mutexes
- The decision to use reader-writer locks should consider factors such as:
	- Ratio of read versus write operations
	- Language-specific implementation details
	- Whether the lock gives preference to readers or writers

---

## Best Practices
- Use reader-writer locks when there are many more reading threads than writing threads
- If most threads are writing, a standard mutex may be more appropriate
- Consider the specific requirements and characteristics of your application when choosing between lock types
